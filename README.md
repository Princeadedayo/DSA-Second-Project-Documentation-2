Palmora Group HR Analysis
# Introduction
The manufacturing industry has long been recognized as a sector with unique workforce
challenges. In this report, we analyze HR data from a manufacturing company with a focus

uncover insights regarding gender inequality and potential pay gaps in the organization. This
analysis is particularly relevant as companies increasingly turn to data-driven decisionmaking to ensure fair HR practices and regulatory compliance across regions and
departments.
The dataset under review comprises employee information with attributes such as Name,
Gender, Department, Salary, Location, and Rating. Special attention is given to issues related
to missing or inconsistent data. For example, some entries have blank or missing Gender
values and some contain the literal string “NULL” for department. In addition to providing an
in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), this report examines whether the company meets.
the new regulation mandating a minimum salary of $90,000, by analyzing salary distributions
in $10,000 bands across different regions.
This report is structured into several sections. First, we describe the data cleaning steps
taken to prepare the dataset for analysis. Thereafter, we examine the distribution of gender
across the organization overall, as well as within distinct departments and regions. We then
analyze performance ratings as they correlate with gender, moving on to a detailed study of
salary structures and pay gaps. Although a bonus calculation is mentioned in the case
study, the absence of a bonus rule dataset prevents us from performing this part of the
analysis. The report concludes with key .
